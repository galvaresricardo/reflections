When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I think that is a good tool to be used when you are working with other people in the same project or if you want that some people avaluate your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Eventually, you are working in a different part of the project, that can get demaged or spoiled if you synced with the github and the current changes that have been made inside the repository.
